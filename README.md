# Lesson 10

## Getting started
To make a project use the following:

```
shift + command + P
Java: Create Java Project
```

You will select a folder to house your project then VSCode will generate a project there.

The project will have a class that contains everything. The class is generally named the same as the file name such as App.java

Within the class you will have a main class that will be needed for Java to run this program. This is necessary and the file will not run unless it has it. The completed first classes look like this:

```
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Arrays
Arrays are a data type that stores values. You can store one or many values within the array. The array is then named by a variable in order to reference it. An array has many built in methods that can be used such as length, etc. When naming the array you will need to type the array depending on what data type will be inside the array.
