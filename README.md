# Lesson 9

## Getting started

To make a project use the following:

```
shift + command + P
Java: Create Java Project
```

You will select a folder to house your project then VSCode will generate a project there.

The project will have a class that contains everything. The class is generally named the same as the file name such as App.java

Within the class you will have a main class that will be needed for Java to run this program. This is necessary and the file will not run unless it has it. The completed first classes look like this:

```
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Loops
Loops are important as they can allow you to go through data or conditions to find something that matches what you want to output. You can also loop through different data types and attach other methods to perform an action on one of the data in the dataset.
