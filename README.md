# Lesson 7

## Getting started
To make a project use the following:

```
shift + command + P
Java: Create Java Project
```

You will select a folder to house your project then VSCode will generate a project there.

The project will have a class that contains everything. The class is generally named the same as the file name such as App.java

Within the class you will have a main class that will be needed for Java to run this program. This is necessary and the file will not run unless it has it. The completed first classes look like this:

```
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Conditionals
Conditionals are if, then statements that check the condition of a variable, data type, etc. and will run code depending on whether the value is true or false. Additional steps can be taken with and else if condition. For more on conditionals in Java you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html">click here</a>

## Switches
Switches are similar to if, then statements except they use a different syntax to get the result. For more on switch statements in Java you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html"> click here</a>
